## ⚡️ Tips for Success

* Read the recommended chapters of each book and take notes.
* Follow a consistent study schedule, dedicating at least 2-3 hours per day.
* Implement each concept as code immediately after learning.
* Document your projects on GitHub with proper README files.
* Share your progress and projects on LinkedIn or other platforms for feedback.
