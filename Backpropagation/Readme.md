In Deep Learning, memorization is when a model learns to remember the training data exactly, rather than understanding the underlying patterns or generalizing well to new, unseen data.

üîç How Memorization Happens:
The model becomes too complex (too many layers, too many parameters) and can perfectly fit the training data.

Instead of learning the general patterns, the model simply "memorizes" the input-output mappings of the training set.

This leads to overfitting, where the model performs extremely well on the training data but poorly on new data (test set).

‚ö° Example:
Imagine training a deep learning model on a dataset of cat images. If the model memorizes the dataset:

It will correctly identify the cats in the training images.

But it may fail to recognize a new image of a cat because it has not learned the general features of a "cat" (like ears, fur, eyes) but just memorized the specific training images.

üöÄ How to Avoid Memorization:
Use Regularization Techniques (like L2 Regularization, Dropout).

Use Data Augmentation to increase data variety.

Make sure the model has a balanced complexity (not too many layers/parameters).

Use Early Stopping during training.
