## What is NLP?
### Natural language processing (NLP) is a machine learning technology that gives computers the ability to interpret, manipulate, and comprehend human language. Organizations today have large volumes of voice and text data from various communication channels like emails, text messages, social media newsfeeds, video, audio, and more. They use NLP software to automatically process this data, analyze the intent or sentiment in the message, and respond in real time to human communication.

## How does NLP work?
### Natural language processing (NLP) combines computational linguistics, machine learning, and deep learning models to process human language.

## Computational linguistics

### Computational linguistics is the science of understanding and constructing human language models with computers and software tools.
